# Image Style Transfer

This is a <b>website to change the image style to the style you want.</b>

Given one content image and one style image, we <b>create a new, target image which should contain our desired content and style components</b>.

An example is shown below, where the content image is of a woman, and the style image is of Starry night. The generated target image still contains the woman but is stylized with the colors and textures of the style image.
